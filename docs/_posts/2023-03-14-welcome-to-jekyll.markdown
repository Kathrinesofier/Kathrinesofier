## The data set

Welcome to the intriguing world of crime and law enforcement in San Francisco! The dataset offers a comprehensive look into the reported crimes within the San Francisco Police Department. From the bustling streets of downtown to the peaceful neighborhoods of the suburbs, this dataset gives an insight into the date, day of week, time, location and resolution of the different reported crimes.

# The dark side of San Francisco

San Francisco, a vibrant and dynamic city on the west coast of the United States, is known for its iconic landmarks, diverse neighborhoods, and rich cultural heritage. However, amidst the beauty and charm of this city, there is also a darker side - car vandalism and theft. The act of stealing and willfully damaging or defacing public or private property has been a persistent problem in San Francisco, leaving its mark on the city's landscape and sparking public debate.

In an article called "SFNext: Theft, car break-ins continue to plague San Francisco residents" from CBS Bay Area, it is mentioned that more than half of all San Francisco residents have been a victim of theft or larceny. Many of these crimes include a staggering number of car break-ins - especially where tourists like to gather. Besides the crimes creating an unsafe envirment it is also bad for tourism and business. It is further mentioned that some small business owners and workers are urging city officials to put the brakes on it. One owner, Smith, even says "I haven't seen any kind of task force. I haven't seen any kind of police presence." To be fair, San Francisco is a big city, and it may be hard for the police to be everywhere. However, a comprehensive analysis of the crime occurrences could help in finding a solution to the problem. 

Police reports of vandalism and vehicle theft incidents in San Francisco can help us understand the geographical distribution of the problem and identify hotspots where the crimes are more common. This can help law enforcement agencies to target their resources more effectively and develop strategies to prevent or reduce car theft and vandalism in these areas. 

Moreover, by examining the characteristics of the incidents, we can identify patterns and trends. For instance, are there specific times of day or days of the week when car vandalism and theft incidents are more common? By answering these questions, we can gain a better understanding of the factors that contribute to the crimes in San Francisco, and help both the citizens and the law enforcement.

# The connection between vandalism and theft

The data supports the news stories and underlines that there is a big problem with "malicious mischief, vandalism of vehicles," and "stolen automobiles." Comparing the two, they seem very closely related. There are more cases of stolen automobiles than vandalism, but they follow the same general pattern. This leads us to believe that a stolen automobile is often also vandalized or the other way around. If a criminal gets the opportunity to vandalize a car, chances are it will also get stolen. Therefore it should also be noted that some of these crimes may be the same, so the number of occurrences is not the whole truth. On a positive note, solving one would also create a significant indent in the other. From the plots, it can be seen that crime occurrences peak on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. This suggests a more prominent police force should be distributed on the weekend. Moreover, the spike could be due to citizens traveling less on the weekend, letting the car stay in the same place for multiple days. So another initiative to lessen the chance of car theft or vandalism would be to move the car on the weekend. This is, however, not explicit from the data. Nevertheless, at this stage, it is worth a try. Now the questions left are, where should the police be? Or where should you move your car? And lastly, at what times?


# Where to be and where to station police

| *Maps shown over the count of car vandalisms for each day of the week. It is seen that the count of car vandalism crimes is more prone to be reported, and hereby happen during the weekend* | 

The map shows the already established trend of crime rates intensifying on the weekend. It also shows a clear trend concerning what districts have an especially high crime rate, regardless of the day of the week. The district with the highest car theft and vandalism rate is Ingleside, followed by the neighboring Bayview. Richmond, Park, and Central districts have the lowest crime rate. 

So a recommendation for the local police force would be to focus more on Ingleside and Bayview and put in extra forces, especially on the weekend. Furthermore, as a citizen living in northern Ingleside or close to the border of Park, a recommendation could be to park your car across the border during the weekend. 

However, there is still the question of whether there are specific times of the day when the police force and citizens should be more vigilant. Moreover, are they the same across districts? 

# When to be vigilant?

In general the pattern is the same across all districts. The crimes mostlu occcurces after five aclock in the afternoon and until around midnight. But apparntly not as much during the night. The reson for this could be many, maybe it would make to much noise? No matter the reason the plots gives a good starting point for police rotations. Ingleside, Mission, Nothern and Richmond have a peak right around five aclock, whereas the southerne peak is clearly around eleven pm and midnight. Overall, it can be said that paperwork and similar desk work should be schedule to the beginning of the work day, and street patrols should be shecdules with the highst intensity during the late afternoon and late eveing / early night hours. 

The city of San Fransico can still become a safer place to live and visit. However, with some more strategic police presence and vigilance from the citizen, it is the apparent hope of these authors that San Fransico will get back to its full prime.
